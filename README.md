# Machine-Learning-2
- Project Overview  
This project explores several machine learning algorithms for binary classification, focusing on Logistic Regression, Gradient Descent, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. I perform experiments with synthetic datasets to compare the performance of these algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy and computation time. Additionally, I explore the AdaBoost classifier with different decision tree depths using the Breast Cancer dataset.


- Future Improvements  
Add regularization to gradient descent algorithms.  
Implement more advanced optimization algorithms like Adam or RMSProp.  
Extend experiments to real-world datasets beyond synthetic data.
